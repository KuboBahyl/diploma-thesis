In this work, we proposed an effective numerical method to compute the time evolution of vortex ring in superfluid He-II. VF's performance was improved by neglegcting the Biot-Savart integral and updating the LIA calculation instead (\ref{LIA_update}). Simulation well replicates the physical processes and performs sufficient stability when using testing vortex ring of radius $R \in \langle 500, 2000\rangle\mu\text{m}$ in resolution $\delta \in (60-100)\mu\text{m}$.
