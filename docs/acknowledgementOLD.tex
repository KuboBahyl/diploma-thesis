My special thanks go to my supervisor, David Schmoranzer, who gave me a  lot of experiences, knowledge and much more of his time, without which I definitely could not write this Thesis. Together with consultant Martin Jackson, they guided me during the whole experiment and helped me to understand all the important aspects included in this work. Moreover, I am thankful to Ladislav Skrbek and Patrik Švančara for giving me such a great opportunity to find out how astounding the experimental physics can be and to work with Superfluidity group within Charles University in Prague.

In the end, I would like to hugely thank my friends and family for all their \textit{„Good luck"} and \textit{„Keep going"} motivational quotes and other sort of supports, which I deeply appreciated.
