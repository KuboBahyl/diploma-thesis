First and foremost, I would like to express my sincere thanks to my supervisor, David Schmoranzer, for his continuous support during my master studies, his enthusiasm and immense knowledge, even under the worst circumstances.\\
Also, I would like to thank the rest of the superfluid research group: Emil Varga, Martin Jackson, Prof. L.Skrbek and Patrik Švančara, for their insightful comments and given opportunities.

Most of the Thesis was written during my daily visits of the 	\textit{VacuumLabs} company and various cafés in Bratislava, Prague and Žilina, such as \textit{Satori Stage, Foxford, Sweet beans, black., Vnitroblock, Cafedu} and \textit{Café Republika}, which I would like to acknowledge, for making the task a lot more lightweight and an enjoyable exercise.

My deep thanks also belong to my family and girlfriend for regularly rejecting my tendency to not finish the academic track, thus encouraging me to finish this Thesis.

Lastly, I would like to express my disappointment about faculty recommendation to use \textit{Mathworks} software company's products (Matlab), use of which extended all my data processing works into an abnormal time scale.
