In this Thesis, mechanical resonators such as \textit{tuning forks, wires are discs} are used to probe superfluid helium in the two-fluid regime at temperatures between temperatures $1.0\unit{K} < T < 2.17\unit{K}$. The principal aim of the experimental part is to study the drag forces arising from the superfluid and the nucleation and development of quantum turbulence. The obtained data, also with those from the ballistic regime $ T < 0.6\unit{K}$, are used to test a proposed \textit{Universal scaling relation} describing the drag forces in high-Stokes-number oscillatory flow.\\
The experimental work is complemented by developing and validating the tools necessary for numerical simulations of quantized vortex dynamics in superfluid helium. In this part, dynamics of a single quantized vortex ring are studied using the \textit{Vortex filament model}.
